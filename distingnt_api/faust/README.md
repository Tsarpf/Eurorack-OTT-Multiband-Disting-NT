# distingNT_API/faust
These files provide an architecture framework for running [Faust](https://faust.grame.fr) on the disting NT. This is a temporary home for these files - we anticipate contributing them to the official Faust project when complete.

The API was added in version 1.7.0 of the module firmware. Please join the Discord for discussion - see [here](https://www.modwiggler.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=287914).
